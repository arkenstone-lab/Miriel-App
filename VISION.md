# **Miriel: Vision & Roadmap**

> **The reflection layer for anyone who wants to grow.**

---

## **Why Miriel Exists**

Reflection is the highest-leverage habit a person can build. It drives better decisions, faster learning, and clearer priorities. Yet it's the first thing that gets dropped when life gets busy.

The problem isn't motivation. It's friction. Blank-page journaling feels like homework. Structured templates are too rigid. And no existing tool helps you *revisit* what you've written. Notes pile up, unread, and the insights trapped inside them go to waste.

Miriel eliminates that friction. A 3-minute AI-guided conversation replaces the blank page. Automatic summaries replace manual review. And every AI-generated insight links back to the original entry, so you never have to wonder where it came from.

The result is a compounding loop:

**Record → Summarize → Reflect → Grow**

Over weeks and months, patterns surface: what drains your energy, where your best ideas come from, which commitments slip through the cracks. Miriel makes those patterns visible and actionable.

---

## **The Origin Story**

Miriel started with a frustration the founding team shared: hundreds of notes scattered across apps, yet no clear picture of how we were spending our time or what we were learning.

We tried the existing tools. Blank-page journals collected dust. Template-based apps felt like busywork. AI summarizers produced outputs we couldn't trust. None of them closed the loop between writing and learning.

So we asked a simple question:

> **What if AI could turn a 3-minute conversation into a living, searchable record of your growth?**

Not a note-taking app. A system that reads, summarizes, and connects your thoughts, and always shows you the evidence.

That's what we built.

---

## **What Makes Miriel Different**

The journaling space is crowded, but most tools fall into one of two traps: simple note-takers with no intelligence, or AI apps that hallucinate insights disconnected from what you actually wrote.

Miriel is neither.

### **1. Evidence-Linked AI: Trust Through Traceability**

Every AI-generated summary sentence links back to the original entry. Users can always verify *where* an insight came from. No hallucination, no black-box magic.

In an era where users are increasingly skeptical of AI outputs, **traceability is a competitive advantage**.

### **2. Conversation, Not a Blank Page**

Miriel guides a natural 3-phase check-in: Plan, Detail, Reflection. The AI adapts questions to context. Users who have never journaled before can start and finish in under 3 minutes.

This isn't incremental UX improvement. It fundamentally changes who can journal.

### **3. The Review Loop: Value After Capture**

Most journaling apps stop at capture. Miriel delivers value *after* you write:

- **Daily summaries** generated automatically on save
- **Weekly reviews** surfacing 3–5 key themes with source links
- **Monthly reflections** revealing long-term patterns

The system builds a compounding knowledge graph. The longer you use it, the more valuable it becomes, and the harder it is to leave.

### **4. Habit Engine: Behavior Change by Design**

Streaks, XP, levels, and badges borrow from Duolingo's proven retention playbook. Small daily wins compound into lasting behavior change.

Retention is not an afterthought. It is a core product feature.

### **5. Reflection Infrastructure for AI Agents**

Miriel is not only for humans. As AI agents become autonomous actors with long-running goals, they need a structured way to record decisions, evaluate outcomes, and improve over time. Miriel will provide a dedicated agent-facing service, separate from the human interface, that lets AI agents use the same reflection loop: **Record → Summarize → Reflect → Improve**.

This positions Miriel as **reflection infrastructure for both humans and machines**, a category no existing journaling or productivity tool is building toward. In a world where billions of AI agents will operate alongside people, the ability to serve both as customers is a fundamental expansion of the addressable market.

## **User Scenario**

**Sarah** is a product manager at a mid-size tech company. She runs three projects simultaneously and has 6+ meetings a day.

### **Monday, 9:02 AM**
Sarah opens Miriel over coffee. Her dashboard shows a 12-day streak, and yesterday's AI-extracted todos are waiting: *"Follow up with design on onboarding flow"* and *"Send revised timeline to client."* She scans the list, taps one as complete, and heads into her first meeting. **Under 30 seconds.**

### **Monday, 6:45 PM**
On her commute, a Miriel notification nudges her: *"Ready for today's check-in?"* She taps it open. The AI asks: *"What was the most important thing that happened today?"* She mentions a breakthrough in a client call and a blocker with engineering. The AI follows up: *"What would help unblock that?"* She thinks for a moment and types her plan. The AI extracts a new todo: *"Schedule sync with engineering lead about API timeline."* Entry saved. Daily summary generated automatically. **3 minutes.**

### **Friday, 7:00 PM**
A weekly review notification arrives: *"Your week in review is ready."* Sarah opens it and finds 5 key themes, each linked to the specific entries where they originated. She notices a pattern. Three days in a row, she mentioned being blocked by the same dependency. She decides to escalate it Monday.

### **Last Day of the Month**
Miriel sends a monthly review notification. The review surfaces a bigger picture: her most productive weeks correlated with fewer context-switches. She shares this insight with her manager in their next 1-on-1.

**Sarah never "journaled" before Miriel.** She just checked her todos in the morning, answered a few questions in the evening, and let Miriel surface the patterns. The notifications kept her in the loop without any extra effort.

## **Market Opportunity**

### **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**

Miriel sits at the intersection of three large and growing markets:

| Market | 2025 Est. | Projected | CAGR | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Digital Journal Apps | ~$5.7B | ~$13.6B by 2033 | ~11.5% | [Straits Research](https://straitsresearch.com/report/digital-journal-apps-market), [Future Market Insights](https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/digital-journal-apps-market) |
| Corporate Coaching & L&D | ~$100B+ (global) | ~$175B by 2031 | ~9% | [Mordor Intelligence](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/executive-coaching-and-leadership-development-market) |
| Mental Health & Wellness Apps | ~$7.5B | ~$17.5B by 2030 | ~14.6% | [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/mental-health-apps-market-report) |

### **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**

Miriel's direct market is AI-powered premium journaling apps. The Professional segment of the digital journaling market is expected to reach ~$5.0B by 2035 ([Market Research Future](https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/digital-journal-apps-market-29194)). Additionally, the user base for daily AI agent usage is expanding rapidly (AI agent market CAGR ~46%, [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/ai-agents-market-report)), and these users represent a core early adopter group with high receptivity to AI-native productivity tools.

### **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**

Initially targeting Korean/English-speaking knowledge workers and students who are already comfortable with AI tools. The strategy is to grow from the segments that show the strongest response, with a position that naturally extends from B2C to B2B.

### **Competitive Landscape**

The space has proven winners, but no one has combined AI journaling with evidence-linking and a habit engine:

| Player | Category | Scale | What They Do Well | Gap Miriel Fills |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Day One** | Journaling | ~50K monthly downloads, acquired by Automattic (2021) | Polished UX, multimedia entries, end-to-end encryption | No AI intelligence, no review loop, no summaries |
| **Reflectly** | AI Journaling | 1M+ users, $5.97M raised | AI-driven mood tracking, CBT-based prompts | No evidence-linking, wellness-focused (not productivity), no todo extraction |
| **Calm** | Mental Wellness | 4M+ subscribers, ~$596M revenue (2024), $2B valuation | Sleep stories, brand partnerships, B2B wellness | Meditation-first, not journaling or reflection |
| **Headspace** | Mental Wellness | 2.8M+ subscribers, 70M+ downloads, $320M raised | Guided meditation, clinical partnerships | No journaling, no personal knowledge graph |
| **Journey** | Journaling | Cross-platform, Google-integrated | Clean UI, Google Drive sync | No AI features, no summaries, no gamification |

**Miriel's positioning**: None of the existing players combine (1) AI-guided conversational check-in, (2) evidence-linked summaries, (3) automatic todo extraction, and (4) a gamified habit engine in a single product. The journaling apps lack intelligence. The wellness apps lack reflection depth. Miriel bridges both.

**Journaling apps** are Miriel's direct market. The sector is growing steadily as AI-powered features, cloud sync, and mobile-first design replace traditional pen-and-paper journaling. Miriel's conversational AI and evidence-linked summaries position it at the premium end of this space.

**Corporate coaching and L&D** is where the B2B expansion (Phase 3) unlocks outsized value. Organizations are spending over $100B globally on executive coaching, leadership training, and employee development. Miriel's team edition can serve as a lightweight, scalable reflection layer that complements existing coaching programs, at a fraction of the cost of traditional 1-on-1 coaching.

**Mental health and wellness apps** represent an adjacent expansion path. Mood tracking, stress indicators, and wellbeing check-ins are natural extensions of Miriel's daily reflection workflow. This market is growing at ~15% CAGR, driven by increasing awareness and employer-sponsored digital wellness programs.

**Why now?**

Three market shifts make this the right moment for Miriel:

**1. Tool fatigue is creating demand for less, not more.** People now rely on more productivity apps than ever, yet the result is not productivity but overhead. Switching between tools for notes, todos, calendars, and reviews creates fragmentation, not clarity. Users are gravitating toward tools that consolidate and simplify. A 3-minute check-in that replaces scattered note-taking, todo tracking, and self-review is exactly what the market is asking for.

**2. Self-improvement and wellness spending is structurally growing.** Consumer spending on personal development, mental health, physical wellness, and career growth has grown consistently year over year. Younger demographics treat self-investment as a default, not a luxury, whether it is therapy, fitness, coaching, upskilling, or journaling. This is not a trend. It is a generational shift in how people allocate time and money toward becoming better versions of themselves, both personally and professionally. Journaling sits at the intersection of productivity, wellness, and career development.

**3. The economics of AI-native consumer products have fundamentally shifted.** The cost of running large language models has dropped dramatically over the past 18 months. Features that were economically unviable just two years ago, such as personalized AI conversations, real-time summarization, and intelligent content extraction per user, can now be delivered at scale within a sustainable unit economics model. This is not just a technology unlock. It is a business model unlock. Miriel's entire AI pipeline (conversational check-in, auto-tagging, summary generation, todo extraction) runs on this new cost structure, making a fully AI-native journaling product viable as a consumer business for the first time.

**4. AI agents are becoming autonomous, and they need reflection infrastructure.** The AI agent market is projected to grow at ~46% CAGR ([Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/ai-agents-market-report)), with agents increasingly handling complex, multi-step tasks over extended timeframes. As agents move from simple tool-calling to goal-directed autonomous behavior, the ability to review past decisions and improve strategies becomes essential infrastructure, not an optional add-on. Yet no one is building it. Miriel's existing reflection pipeline is a direct architectural match for this emerging need, giving us a head start that compounds with every month of development.

### **The Moat**

Miriel's defensibility comes from four reinforcing layers:

**1. Low-Friction Retention: The App That Gives Time Back**

Most apps compete for screen time. Miriel does the opposite. A 3-minute check-in and a 30-second morning glance is all it takes. Summaries, todos, and reviews are generated automatically. Users get value *without* staying in the app.

This is counterintuitively powerful for retention. There is no guilt about "not using it enough," no feature fatigue, no friction to resist. The less time Miriel demands, the more consistently people come back. Competitors who add more features to differentiate actually move further from this advantage.

**2. Data Flywheel: Intelligence That Compounds Over Time**

Every entry Miriel processes strengthens the system's value for that user. Daily entries feed into weekly summaries. Weekly summaries feed into monthly reviews. Monthly reviews surface long-term patterns (energy trends, recurring blockers, productivity correlations) that are invisible at any single-entry level.

At 3 months of use, Miriel can surface cross-entry insights no competitor can replicate for that user without the same data history. At 12 months, the personal knowledge graph becomes an irreplaceable professional asset. The AI does not just get more data. It gets more *context*, and context is what makes the difference between a generic summary and a genuinely useful insight.

**3. B2B Network Effect: From Personal Tool to Organizational Infrastructure**

When Miriel expands into team and enterprise use (Phase 3), a new dynamic emerges. Individual reflections aggregate into team-level signals: shared blockers, team energy patterns, alignment gaps. Managers gain visibility without surveillance, because insights are derived from voluntary, individual check-ins.

The more team members who use Miriel, the richer the organizational signal becomes. This creates a network effect within organizations: the tool becomes more valuable for managers as adoption grows, and more valuable for individuals as team insights improve their own context. Once embedded in a team's workflow, Miriel transitions from a personal productivity tool to organizational infrastructure, a category that is extremely sticky.

**4. Agent Reflection Infrastructure: Serving the Next Billion Customers**

As AI agents take on increasingly complex, long-running goals (managing projects, executing multi-step workflows, coordinating with other agents), they face the same challenge humans do: without structured reflection, past mistakes repeat and strategies stagnate. Agents need a self-improvement loop: record decisions, evaluate outcomes, detect patterns, and refine strategies.

Miriel is uniquely positioned to provide this. The core pipeline built for humans (**Record → Summarize → Discover Patterns → Improve**) transfers directly to AI agents through a dedicated Agent API. Agents can programmatically log decisions, query long-term patterns, and track goal attainment, all on the same infrastructure that serves human users.

This is not a speculative bet. Our team is actively building B2B AI agent systems, gaining firsthand insight into how agents operate in real work environments and what data infrastructure they require. This operational experience directly informs the design of Miriel's Agent API. We are not guessing what agents need; we are learning it by building them.

The strategic implication is profound: while every other journaling and productivity tool is built exclusively for human users, Miriel is designed to serve both humans and AI agents on a unified reflection infrastructure. In a future where billions of AI agents operate alongside people, this dual-serving capability transforms Miriel from a consumer app into a platform-level service, expanding the addressable market by orders of magnitude.

Together, these four layers create a compounding advantage. Low friction drives consistent usage. Consistent usage builds irreplaceable data. Organizational adoption locks in value at the team level. And agent reflection infrastructure extends Miriel's reach from millions of human users to billions of AI agents, positioning Miriel not just as an app, but as a foundational layer for how both humans and machines improve over time.

## **Business Model**

Miriel is built on a Freemium model with three revenue streams: individual subscription, enterprise subscription, and agent API.

**Free**: Basic conversational journaling, daily summaries, limited todo extraction. The entry point for building journaling habits and experiencing product value.

**Pro (Individual Subscription)**: Unlimited summary regeneration, weekly/monthly reviews, long-term pattern analysis, AI personalization (summary style, focus areas, custom instructions). As data accumulates, Pro's value increases, driving natural conversion.

**Enterprise (Team/Org Subscription)**: Launching in Phase 3. Team reflections, manager dashboards, team health signals, coaching workflows. Provides organization-level insights while preserving individual privacy. The goal is to offer scalable reflection infrastructure at a lower cost than traditional coaching programs.

**Agent API (Usage-Based)**: A dedicated reflection service for AI agents, billed on a usage basis. AI agents with long-term goals can programmatically record decisions, retrieve summaries, and access pattern analysis through Miriel's API. As the AI agent ecosystem scales, this tier positions Miriel to capture value from machine customers alongside human ones.
